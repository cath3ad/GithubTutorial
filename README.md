# Github Tutorial

A **quick and easy** way to set up a personal github. 

Skip a long and difficult learning proces of working with github and do this on a later date.
Only two scripts are needed.

    One to setup github.
    One to use continuously.

The intention is to have a backup or a way to share your

    files
    icons
    scripts
    themes
    ... anything really.

We assume only one person will update the github. No collaboration with others. 
If you want to do this, you definitely will need to learn your github commands.

Having a github makes it easy for distro's to download and install your files.
